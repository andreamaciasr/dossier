This is an application to search for news articles in 3 different newspapers simoultaneosuly. It is meant to be a tool to get a more rounded view of a particular topic, as well as to get a general idea of the political discourse that each newspaper chooses to cover a particular news story, and how it evolves over time.
It pulls information from the API's of The New York Times and The Guardian, and a simple scrapper from the Democracy Now! website.
